## Slide 2: Challenges and Solutions
Our proposed web-based platform AttendIQ helps educational institutions automate attendance management and provide comprehensive analytics for better academic decisions.

### Challenges Faced by Educational Institutions
- Lack of Real-Time Visibility: Admins and faculty struggle to view up-to-date attendance patterns and identify at-risk students.
- Manual Processes: Roll-calls and manual data entry are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to audit.
- Inconsistent Analytics: Institutions lack standardized dashboards for class/subject-wise trends, cohort comparisons, and forecasting.
- Student Engagement Gaps: Students have limited visibility into goals, progress, streaks, and actionable recommendations.

### Proposed Solutions To Address the Challenges
- Centralized Attendance System: A web and mobile platform that automates attendance using secure, rotating QR codes with time-based expiry (20–30s).
- Real-Time Analytics: Class, subject, and cohort dashboards; weekly/monthly trends; goal tracking; days-to-target metrics.
- AI-Driven Insights: Risk prediction (below 60/75%), anomaly detection (suspicious scan patterns), recommendations for improvement.
- Seamless Faculty Workflow: Instant attendance windows, quick overrides, and live class-level visibility.

### Innovation and Uniqueness
- AI-Powered Analytics: Pattern recognition, risk scoring, attendance forecasting, streak analysis.
- QR Code Security: Time-based rotating QR codes to ensure presence during a valid window.
- Real-Time Dashboard: Interactive charts, alerts, goal tracking, and cohort benchmarks for faculty and students.

## Slide 3: Technical Approach
TECHNICAL APPROACH

Data Collection → Centralized Server → AI Analytics Engine → Student/Faculty Dashboards

### Data Collection
- QR Attendance Module
  - Dynamic QR Generation (20–30s rotation)
  - Time-Based Validation (server-synced windows)
  - Class/Period Scheduling (start/end windows)
  - Faculty Override Window

### Centralized Server
- REST APIs (Django + DRF)
- Attendance, Classes, Subjects, Users, Goals
- PostgreSQL (prod), SQLite (dev)
- Role-based Access (Student/Faculty/Admin)

### AI Analytics Engine
- Feature Store: streaks, rolling averages, day-of-week patterns, subject load
- Models: risk classification (scikit-learn/XGBoost), anomalies (Isolation Forest), forecasting (Prophet)
- Outputs: risk level, days to 60/75, trend indicators, recommendations

### Student/Faculty Dashboards
- Real-Time Charts (subject, week, month)
- Goals & Progress (days-to-target)
- Alerts (missed windows, declining trends)
- Exportable Reports

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
- Backend: Django 5, Django REST Framework
- Database: PostgreSQL (prod), SQLite (dev)
- Auth: JWT-based sessions, role policies
- AI/ML: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet
- Deployment: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Gunicorn
- Cloud: Cloud-based infrastructure with auto-scaling

### Business Model (Subscription-based)
**Free User**
- Basic dashboards
- Limited historical data (3 months)
- Standard reports

**Pro User**
- Advanced AI insights
- Extended historical data (3+ years)
- Cohort benchmarks and exports
- Priority support

## Slide 4: Feasibility and Viability

### Features
- Automated QR Attendance: Time-based rotating QR codes with server validation.
- Real-Time Dashboards: Overall %, weekly/monthly trends, subject-wise breakdowns.
- AI Insights: Risk of falling below thresholds (60/75%), forecasting, anomaly alerts.
- Goal Management: Set targets (60/75/90%), track days-to-target, see progress.
- Calendar View: Daily status, period-level history, per-subject details.
- Reporting: Faculty-ready downloads, term summaries, cohort stats.

### Technical Feasibility
AttendIQ uses established web technologies (Django, React) with proven ML libraries (scikit-learn, Prophet, XGBoost) and containerized deployment for reliability and scalability.

### Economic Feasibility
Automated workflows reduce faculty time, improve retention through early intervention, and provide data-driven evidence for planning and accreditation.

### Operational Feasibility
Simple adoption: QR-based class flow for faculty, intuitive dashboards for students, minimal manual intervention, clear documentation and training.

### Viability
- Adaptability: Works with different timetables, grading systems, and class structures.
- Scalability: Cloud-ready, multi-tenant architecture, environment-based configs.

### Potential Challenges | Overcoming Strategies
- Adoption resistance | Clear faculty tools, quick overrides, training modules
- Network/device issues | Offline-ready buffers, retry windows, cached tokens
- Data privacy & security | JWT, TLS, role-based access, audit logs
- Model accuracy early on | Feedback loops, continuous retraining, human-in-the-loop
